            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </note> as in many other things, here jumpe together in this interpretation, The ground they build on, they thus levell: In that ſenſe (ſay they) that our Saviour ſayes that all other ſins, except this, ſhall be forgiven, in the ſame ſenſe he ſayes that this ſhall not be forgiven; but hee meanes not that all thoſe ſinnes are forgiven to every one, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he meanes not that this ſin is not forgiven to every one. Conſequently (ſay they) hee muſt needes ſpeake of facility of pardon in the former, and of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in the latter.

For, ſayes Chriſt, all manner or kinde of ſinne and blaſphemy, elſe, ſhall be forgiven to men: not every particular ſinne to every particular man;
<pb facs="tcp:150804:10"/> for then who ſhall be damned? But all ſinnes in ſome men or other, and by conſequence, this kinde of ſinne in no man.

               <p>Yet with theſe two differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
<pb facs="tcp:150804:11"/> Firſt, our Saviour, in the Evangeliſts, ſpeakes moſt eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of ſinne in ſpeech that is blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie againſt the Holy Ghoſt, not excluding other kindes of Sinne; for, as he ſayes all ſinne and blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven, that is, blaſphemy, or any other ſinne in thought or deed; ſo here againe, this blaſphemy ſhall not be forgiven, nor any other ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt, in thought or deed. It is ſottiſh to thinke that this great ſinne is onely confined to ſpeeches, ſith a man may be as bad or worſe in deedes, as he can be in words. But here in the Hebrewes, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeakes more generally, as well of other ſinnes againſt the Holy Ghoſt, as of blaſphemy.</p>

               <p>But notwithſtanding this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, yet it is ſtill the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt that is here ſpoken of: which thus I prove.</p>
               <p>The Sinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt, is a malicious deniall of, &amp; rage againſt a fundamentall, Evangelicall truth inwardly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, therefore it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, in <hi>Hebr. 6.</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4. Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note>Why it is called the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt? which admits of two ſenſes.

<pb facs="tcp:150804:13"/> muſt ſignifie the Holy God. Or ſecondly, it is taken for the third Perſon in Trinity, in relative oppoſition to the firſt and ſecond Perſons, the Father and Son.</p>
               <p>The ground of the firſt ſenſe and interpretation lies thus: Our Saviour ſayes that all blaſphemy againſt the Sonne of man ſhall be forgiven, but not againſt the Holy Ghoſt; as if he had ſaid, ſo farre forth as you ſin againſt me, appearing but as a man, I will forgive you; but ſo farre forth as you ſinne againſt me, appearing to be God as well as man, I will not forgive you.

               <p>Thus have I (good Reader) as briefly as well I could, laid open thoſe foure things, which ſeeme hard in this matter, and that I hope without any intren<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ching upon the enſuing Treatiſe. My aime herein is, thy ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; if I miſſe of it, it may be, it is either thy prejudicate thoughts, or ſlight peruſall of what is written. But if thou haſt duely weighed all things in the ballance of the Sanctuary, &amp; found any thing too light, tell me of it, and I will either ſatisfie thee, if I can, or crave pardon of God and thee, if I cannot. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever cover the failings of me thy brother from others, ſo long as they doe not endammage others, and Ieſus Chriſt for ever cover thine. For my part I could doe

Though ſuch Sinnes be a fighting againſt the Truth, yet are they not this unpardonable Sinne, except the firſt and principall motion of it doe ariſe from that divine Truth, in ſuch a manner, that he would not commit that Sinne, but for that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truths ſake. For this is a Sin, the very firſt motions whereof, are conceived by the ſight of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truth; ſo that it is a Sinne not only committed in the light, and againſt the light; but by means of it, and even for the Truths ſake.</p>

A dullard, a blinde perſon that hath no eyes to looke above that which is humane, cannot commit this Sinne, but thoſe that are able to ſee and behold the divine Truth. So that in this reſpect, Ignorance is an advantage to a man: For a narrow braine will not ſuffice to conceive this Sinne. The Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apoſtata, and thoſe that come nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to this Sinne, the grand &amp; Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſecutors of any divine Truth, they are men admirable for gifts. There are indeed many inſolent Dunſes and Sots that are malirious; but they receive this malice from the ſpirits of great wits; themſelves are but axes and beetles in their hands. So that it is not a Mouſe that can bring forth this Elephant; nor a Wren that can lay and hatch this Eagle.</p>

               <head>The third Concluſion.</head>
               <p>This Sinne is not engendred and ſtirred up by every Evangelicall Doctrine and Truth, but by the maine and fundamentall Doctrines of the Goſpell. For this was it that begat this Sinne in them, that this Chriſt whom they ſo horribly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, is that Meſſias and Saviour of the World. This was it that made them ſpit out this blaſphemy; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſaw he was ſo. Though therefore there is no Legall, nor Evangelicall Truth, but it hath this property through the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mans nature, to ſtirre up the minde to Sinne; yet no Truth, but a maine and Fundamentall Truth, the excellenteſt Truth, and that which being preſented to the Soule of an
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:150804:27"/> elect Childe of God, doth ſtirre up in him the moſt principall Graces of God, and beget in him an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Love of God: the ſame Truth it is that begets in the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate (if God leave them ſo far unto themſelves) the higheſt and moſt horrible Sinne. For that which is an Inſtrument of holineſſe to the good, is an Inſtrument of impiety to the wicked: and ſo by degrees, that Illumination which is the means of the greateſt Grace in Gods Children, is the means of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Sinnes in the Reprobrate. The Doctrine of the Law begetteth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Graces in the heart of Gods Childe; the Doctrine of the Goſpell more. Every Evangelicall Truth is a means of much Grace; the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall and high points thereof much more: So on the contrary. It is therefore an high Evangelicall Truth, that is, the ſtirrer up of this high Diabolicall Sinne.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou have heard before how this Blaſphemy was conceived by the beames of a Divine Truth that ſhined to the Eye of their Conſcience, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by theſe Scribes and Phariſees diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned indeed that Chriſt was the Sonne of God. This firſt quickned this Monſter, and made it to ſwell and grow in the wombe of their hearts. Now wee are to conſider the Birth of this Sinne, by what means it was brought forth of them.</p>
            <p>This is ſet downe <hi>verſe</hi> 23. For when the Scribes and Phariſees did not only ſee the wonderfull works that our Saviour Chriſt wrought, but did alſo perceive that the people
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:150804:31"/> came thereby to the light of that Truth, which they laboured to the uttermoſt to ſmother and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh: as ſoone as ever they began to deſcry, that that the people were aſtoniſhed at the wonderfull workes of Chriſt; and that in this their aſtoniſhment they began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that he was ſurely the Chriſt: they could not then containe any longer, but preſently breathe out this fearfull Blaſphemy. So that the ſight of the peoples aſtoniſhment, and the hearing of their words, wherby they began to give glory to Chriſt, as the Meſſias and Saviour of the World, was the Mid-Wife that brough forth this Sinne.</p>
            <p>Whence obſerve we theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions concerning this Sinne.</p>

               <p>The cauſe that irritateth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voketh men unto this Blaſphemy, is not within themſelves, but out of themſelves. The matter of this Sinne was within themſelves; but the irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating cauſe was out of themſelves For if this divine Light had ſhined
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:150804:31"/> never ſo brightly upon their owne Soules, howſoever they might have maliced the ſame, yet they would never in that manner have ſpit out Blaſphemies into the cares of men againſt it. For they knew well enough that it was not ſo as they ſaid; and therefore had it not been more in regard of others than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they would never have ſaid ſo. And thus it is in the extreme ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious ſpeeches of many concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning man: men are wont by ſeeing other mens reſpect unto him, to be provoked and ſtirred up thereto.</p>

            <p n="2">2 This were to lift up the Holy Ghoſt above the two other perſons, that a Sinne committed againſt him only were unpardonable.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The Example that wee have here maketh it plaine: For the Sinne was directly committed againſt the perſon of Chriſt. So was <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apoſtates.</p>

               <p>The anſwer is, that it is a Sinne partly againſt the gifts in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and partly againſt the ſame in others: it's committed againſt both. A man would never in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner deſpight the Holy Ghoſt in himſelfe, if he perceived it not in another; neither would he ever have deſpighted it in another, except it had been in himſelf.

            <p n="1">1 It is an Oppoſition: which is not a bare conceit, imagination, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation or aſſertion. For though theſe be where there is an oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet theſe may be without op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. But oppoſition is when a man of purpoſe ſetteth himſelfe againſt another. For Example; a man in armes on horſebacke with ſpeare in hand, though hee ride and runne, and ſhake his ſpeare never ſo much, yet except there bee a perſon, to whom he oppoſeth himſelfe, he cannot in ſo doing be ſaid to make oppoſition; and yet he that maketh oppoſition, uſeth no other kindes of motion. So that admit a man were ſo wicked as to revile and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme alone by himſelfe; yet ſuch a reviling and blaſpheming is no oppoſition.

            <p>But they that commit this Sinne, doe not onely not affect them, but ſet themſelves againſt them; are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites and adverſaries unto them. And this is a greater degree, to bee profeſſed enemies unto profeſſors of the Goſpell, than to be bare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of them; yea, this muſt needs argue much wickedneſſe in the heart.</p>
            <p>For 1 All true profeſſors of the

            <p>But to hate them (as in this caſe) not in regard of any ſuch ſpeciall quarrell againſt them, or in reſpect of any private injury and wrong received from them, but to diſlike (yea to ſpite and maligne) them for their very profeſſion; it is not ſo much to hate Chriſt for them, as to hate Chriſt himſelfe, and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity in them, and to hate them for Chriſt.</p>

            <p>But for one that himſelfe hath acknowledged Chriſt, been enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened by the Spirit of Chriſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced in Conſcience of the truth of the Goſpell, yea, and outwardly made prof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And as this is a great Sin againſt others, ſo is it no leſſe Sinne againſt our ſelves; eſpecially in laying to our owne charge this Sinne above all other. For howſoever in other ſinnes, I may doe another more hurt than my ſelfe; yet if I could lay this Sinne to the charge, though of the greateſt innocent in the World, I ſhould not doe him ſo much hurt, as in laying it upon falſe ſurmiſes and grounds upon my ſelfe.

            <p n="2">2 In that our Saviour deales thus with their Thoughts and the ſecrets of their Soule, and withall is faine to beat upon them with ſo many reaſons to prove them guilty of ſuch a Sinne: this ſhewes the property of thoſe that have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this Sinne, not to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it when it is committed, much leſſe to be grieved and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that they have committed it, So that ſo farre are they from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging it themſelves, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>herein Chriſt oppoſeth unto their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>laſphemy; not ſo much labouring
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:150804:63"/> therein their converſion as their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, that from it he might paſſe to their ſentence of condemnation.</p>
            <p>The queſtion that Chriſt diſputes, is, whether hee did caſt out Devils through <hi>Beelzebub.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Argument whereby he confutes it, and by conſequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces them of furious ſpite and malice, is this:</p>
            <p>If I through the power of <hi>Beel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub</hi> have caſt out theſe Devils, then is the kingdome of Satan di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and at war in it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>But the kingdome of Satan is not divided, and at war in it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Therefore I caſt them not our through the power of <hi>Beelzebub.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt part is true, except they ſhould imagine that herein the Devils plaid one with another, and in mockery or ſome policie made oppoſition one unto another. Which howſoever in words they had been likely to have done, if they had had ſo much cunning then, as ſome in our times now have; yet in their Conſcience, which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:150804:63"/> ſmites at, they coul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t, becauſe it could not poſſibly ſuggeſt unto them the leaſt colour of a reaſon, why the Devils ſhould, as it were upon a Stage play their parts in that manner: but they diſcerned a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt enmity between that Spirit by which Chriſt did this worke, and thoſe that were caſt out; and therfore Chriſt proves it not, but lets it paſſe.</p>
            <p>Whence learne we this practicall method of Chriſt, in dealing with deſperate Sinners, not ſo much to ſtrive to ſtop their mouths, as to touch their conſcience, and therfore not to weary our ſelves with endleſſe wranglings &amp; brawles, as if it were poſſible to ſtay their thoughts: It's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough if we can convince their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; which when we have done, let us leave them and their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence together to decide the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie. If men could obſerve but in ſome meaſure this Rule, the World had not bin ſo full of endles contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies as it is. Chriſt in this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies go's no further then ſo: as if he had ſaid; you ſee &amp; hear, you Scribes
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:150804:64"/> and Phari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>, and your conſciences tell you; and though you bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent enough to deny a manifeſt truth, yet you cannot gainſay this; that there is betweene that Spirit which I uſe, and thoſe that are caſt out, a perfect hatred and jarre, and a moſt fiery diſſention. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if my Spirit (as you ſpightfully and blaſphemouſly affirme againſt knowledge and Conſcience) bee <hi>Beelzebub;</hi> then is there hatred, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, warre, tumult, and civill diſſention amongſt the Devils, one ſeeking the ruine and overthrow of another, and labouring to cut the throat of another. This propoſition Chriſt leaves, though it might bee cavilled at; and a man may dwell all the dayes of his life in cleering of ſuch a propoſition as this, if hee would go about to cleer all oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and cavils.</p>
            <p>Hee paſſeth to the ſecond part, which is this; But the Kingdome of Hell is not divided againſt it ſelfe: as if hee ſhould ſay; But it is too groſſe and abſurd for any, that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:150804:64"/> are maſters of common wit and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to imagine, that Hell is up in armes againſt it ſelfe, and that there is deadly feud amongſt the Devils of Hell, that they warre and fight in this maner, as you are eye-witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of, one againſt another among themſelves.</p>
            <p>This our Saviour Chriſt proves by a ſhort reaſon. For then Satans Kingdome could not ſtand and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, but ſhould be neere unto an end. For that is the ſtate of all Kingdomes rent with civill diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. So that by this reaſon, either they muſt herein ſpeake malitiouſly and againſt Conſcience, or elſe they muſt of neceſſity maintaine the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer abſurdities. And they were no doubt ſpeciall poſitions of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, which Chriſt here frames his Argument of.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Argument is thus conceived.</p>
            <p>By that Spirit, which your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren caſt out Devils by, doe I caſt out Devils.</p>
            <p>But your Children caſt not out
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:150804:65"/> Devils through <hi>Beelzebub.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore neither do I caſt them out by him.</p>
            <p>In this Argument there is ſome doubt what is meant by their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. The beſt of our Interpreters hold it to be meant flatly of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſts Diſciples. But I muſt crave leave to diſſent with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from them: For, 1 there is no more reaſon to call his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples their Children, than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
            <p n="2">2 In holding that Chriſt caſt out Devils through <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> they muſt needs hold that his Diſciples muſt doe it by the ſame Spirit. For it were ſenſeleſſe to imagine, that the Diſciple ſhould doe it by the Spirit of God, and the Maſter by the Devill.</p>
            <p n="3">3 By Children are not unuſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally meant Scholers and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Hence by the Children or Sonnes of the Prophets, are meant thoſe that ſate at their feet to learn: as <hi>Paul</hi> might be called one of <hi>Gamaliels</hi> Children or Sonnes.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:150804:65"/> And therefore I take it, that Chriſt means it of ſome of the Phariſees owne diſciples and ſcholers, that were no profeſſed Diſciples of Chriſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>: which, as it ſeemes, in thoſe times had ſpeciall Gifts to caſt out Devils, for the grace and countenance and confirmation of the true Religion, which the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees ſitting in <hi>Moſes</hi> chaire, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed and taught: And of theſe, I'am perſwaded, Chriſt ſpeaketh in this place.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Hee ſpeaketh of ſome neere unto them, when hee ſaith, They ſhall bee your Iudges: meaning ſuch as they could not with any honeſty appeale from; whereas they might from Chriſts Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Some ſuch are mentioned,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.38. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.49.</note> whom the Diſciples found caſting out Devils.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Except this be the meaning, I am not able to diſcern what force in the world there ſhould be in this argument. For any man may ſee that our Savior taketh it as granted, that
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:150804:66"/> the Phariſees did hold and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that the diſpoſſeſſion that their Children uſed was the act of God, and done by the finger of God. And if it bee ſo underſtood, there is great force in the Reaſon, and it's a ſtronger than the former. And this is the ſenſe of it.</p>
            <p>If I caſt out Devils to no other end and purpoſe in ſubſtance, than many of your honored and renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Schollers doe, then I doe it not by <hi>Beelzebub.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I doe it to no other end than they, but to confirme the ſame do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and faith.</p>
            <p>Therefore I doe it not by <hi>Beel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The propoſition is evident: for els their ends would have been as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary as their Spirits.</p>
            <p>The aſſumption no doubt was as evident. For Chriſt wrought theſe Miracles, to confirme no other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or Doctrine, than what in ſubſtance the Exorciſts did, ſet downe in <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, howſoever there were ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:150804:66"/> in the manner. So that if the Miracles of Chriſt were as effectuall againſt the kingdome of Satan, as their Exorciſts were, and as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>So that our Saviour here makes a diſtinction of Sinnes, that ſome Sinnes are pardonable; that other ſome are unpardonable.</p>
            <p>For the firſt he ſaith, that all Sins, one onely excepted, may be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, yea though a man ſhould revile and blaſpheme even the Son of God himſelfe.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond, hee affirmes that one Sinne onely is utterly impardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and that Sinne is the blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>In the former part, when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaith, that every Sin and Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy ſhall be forgiven unto men; His meaning is not that they ſhall certainly and abſolutely be forgiven to all men, ſo that no man for any Sin whatſoever ſhall goe to Hell, if he can keep himſelf from that one ſin
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:150804:73"/> that commeth after.</p>
            <p>For then there ſhould goe but a few, to ſpeake of, to Hell: whereas it is cleere by Gods Word, that the number of thoſe that ſhall be ſaved is but a ſmall number in compariſon of thoſe that ſhall be damned.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the Scripture is as cleere that men are and ſhall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for other Sinnes beſides this. The rich glutton in the Goſpell was not damned for this Sinne,<note place="margin">

            <pb facs="tcp:150804:73"/>

And there are none that live in the Church, and have the uſe of their underſtanding, but hee vouchſafeth them ſufficient means to bring them to Repentance, if they would uſe them, and ſeeke after them. Hee vouchſafeth indeed to ſome greater and more effectuall means than to other ſome, and doth worke more

               </label> 1 This point ſerves to comfort thoſe that are afflicted, and mourne, and groane under the burthen of their Sinnes, and through the ſight of their Sinnes are brought as it were to the Gates of Hell, and to the pits brinke of deſpaire. How ſhould the conſideration of this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them againſt all ſuch Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that our Saviour himſelfe ſhould with his owne mouth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that all Sinnes but one are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given to men? So that be their Sins never ſo many, never ſo great, yet if it be not that Sinne, there is hope of mercy, if due means be uſed, and they doe not deſperately exclude themſelves there-from.</p>
            <p n="2">2 This ſerves not to encourage and hearten any to goe on in their wonted courſe of ſinning; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the contrary. It is the unſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable goodneſſe of God to be ready
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:150804:75"/> to pardon all manner of Sins. But it's groſſe folly and impiety in Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to thinke and conceit that hee will pardon any but ſuch as uſe means for the getting of a pardon. The Prince is a gratious Prince in pardoning Traitors or Murtherers. But this conſideration, that the King may doe it, or hath done it, is no motive to make thoſe that are Traitors or Murtherers ſecure, much leſſe to goe in their Treaſons and Murthers: But they muſt be content to ſue out, yea to pay deare oft for their pardons, or elſe their hope will lye in the duſt. So is it with God. It's true, he is mercifull, and ready to pardon any Sinne; yet he hath and will condemne the greateſt part of the World: and he will pardon none but ſuch as uſe the means to ſue out and purchaſe their pardon, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking their Sinnes by true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and humbling themſelves b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3 The conſideration of this
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:150804:75"/> may ſerve for a ſpeciall ſtay to them, who by the ſubtill Temptations of Satan are made to beleeve that they have committed the impardonable Sinne here ſpoken of. And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Satan, abuſing their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, puts theſe conceits into the minds of thoſe which are the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt from that Sinne, to wit, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and afflicted Sinners. Whereas thoſe are leaſt troubled with the feare thereof, that either have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it, or are neereſt to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of it. This therefore may help them ſomewhat, who know not ſo well what the Nature of that Sinne is, to conſider what particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Sinnes God is reported in the Word to have forgiven to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and to conſider whether their owne Sinne bee not one of the ſame kinde; which if it be, they may thence then infallibly conclude that it is not that impardonable Sinne.</p>
            <p>All other Sinnes then are at the leaſt pardonable; yea they have been pardoned in ſome or other, and may be pardoned in any: But in whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:150804:76"/> this Sinne is found, which we principally intreat of, to wit, of Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt; he is certainly without all redemp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion a fire-brand of Hell.

And as wee muſt not tye his Love and Mercy, which is moſt free, to the perſons of all men; ſo wee muſt not tye it to all Sinnes any further than himſelfe hath tied it. It ſhould ſuffice us, that God is ſo infinite in mercy as to forgive ſome men; and to forgive in ſome men all Sinnes ſaving one. If he had ſaved but one Man, and pardoned but one Sinne in that one Man (if it were poſſible for any one Man to commit but one Sinne) his Mercy had been infinite. Hee might as freely have excepted any, yea many other Sinnes, as whoredome, pride,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:150804:77"/> perjury, Apoſtaſie, &amp;c. But this we muſt know, that God, as he is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in mercy, ſo he is infinite in his juſtice: And in his holy wiſedome and providence he ſo mingleth and conjoyneth theſe twain, that the one limiteth the other. So that God is ſo farre forth mercifull as will ſtand with his infinite juſtice; and ſo farre forth juſt, as will ſtand with his infinite Mercy. His Mercy doth not drowne his Iuſtice, nor his Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice his Mercy.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Goh ſheweth Mercy to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that hee might glorifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his mercy. But in ſhewing mercy to ſuch a Sinne, hee might rather ſeeme both to ſtaine his Mercy, and to diſgrace his Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
            <p n="3">3 There is no Sinne whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that makes God mercileſſe, but in reſpect onely of the perſon. In this regard therefore is this Sin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable, becauſe the Lord hath decreed that none ſhall commit it but Reprobrates, in whom every Sin is unpardonable.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:150804:77"/>4 This very Sinne potentially is forgiven in all the Elect. For it is not of themſelves that they doe not commit it, but of God, who bridles their wils. For even they alſo have the ſeeds of all Sinnes in themſelves; as the Cubs of Woolves and Foxes, of all miſchiefe and ravening, though they either cannot yet do, or dye ere they do hurt ought.</p>
